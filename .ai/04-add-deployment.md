User: Can I use Github Actions to compile my website and serve it on Github Sites? What are the steps to do that on a completely new repository?

===

ChatGPT: Sure, you can use GitHub Actions to automate the process of compiling and deploying your website to GitHub Pages (commonly referred to as GitHub Sites). Here's a step-by-step guide to set this up for a completely new repository.

    Create a new GitHub Repository: Start by creating a new repository on GitHub. If it's a public repository, GitHub Pages and Actions will be available for free.

    Set Up Your Website: Add your website code to the repository. Depending on how your site is built, you may be using tools like Jekyll, Hugo, or other static site generators.

    Create a GitHub Action Workflow:
        In your repository, create a new folder named .github, and inside it create another folder named workflows.
        Inside the workflows folder, create a new file with a .yml extension (e.g., deploy.yml).
        Edit the file to define your build and deploy process. Here's an example for a Jekyll-based website:

yaml

name: Build and Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # or your default branch name

jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Ruby
      uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
      with:
        ruby-version: 2.7

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        gem install bundler
        bundle install

    - name: Build site
      run: bundle exec jekyll build

    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./_site

This example uses Jekyll to build the site, and the peaceiris/actions-gh-pages action to handle the deployment to GitHub Pages. You'll want to customize the build step according to how your site is built.

    Configure GitHub Pages in Your Repository Settings:
        Go to the 'Settings' tab of your repository.
        Scroll down to the 'GitHub Pages' section.
        Select the branch that you're deploying to (e.g., gh-pages, if you're using the action mentioned above).
        Click 'Save'.

    Push Changes to Trigger the Action: Now, whenever you push changes to the specified branch (e.g., main), the GitHub Action will run, building and deploying your site to GitHub Pages.

Remember to tailor the build steps in the workflow file to match the requirements of your specific site (e.g., different build commands if you're using a different static site generator). If your site requires additional environment variables or secrets, you'll need to add those to the workflow file as well.

User: Can you:
1. Tell me more about GITHUB_TOKEN, is that already provided?
2. List alternatives to `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`
3. Use `npm run build` to build the website and upload just the folder 'static'

===

ChatGPT: Certainly! Let's dive into the details:
1. About GITHUB_TOKEN

The GITHUB_TOKEN is a special GitHub authentication token that is automatically provided by GitHub when GitHub Actions run. You don't need to manually create this token. It has the necessary permissions to perform most common tasks within your repository, such as pushing commits, creating releases, etc. In the context of deploying to GitHub Pages, it provides the necessary authorization to push the compiled website to the designated GitHub Pages branch.
2. Alternatives to peaceiris/actions-gh-pages

While peaceiris/actions-gh-pages is a popular choice for deploying to GitHub Pages, there are other actions and methods you might consider:

    JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action: Another action designed to deploy to GitHub Pages with some customization options.
    Manual Deployment: You can write your custom script to push the build files to the gh-pages branch using standard Git commands. This requires a bit more setup but provides total control over the process.

3. Using npm run build and Uploading the 'static' Folder

Certainly! If your build process involves running npm run build and your compiled website resides in the static folder, you can customize the GitHub Action accordingly. Here's an example:

yaml

name: Build and Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # or your default branch name

jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14' # or your required Node.js version

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Build site
      run: npm run build

    - name: Deploy 'static' folder to GitHub Pages
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./static

This workflow will check out your code, set up Node.js, install dependencies using npm install, build the site using npm run build, and then deploy the static folder to GitHub Pages.

Remember to adjust the Node.js version and other paths according to your specific project needs. If you decide to use a different action or method for deployment, make sure to modify the deployment step accordingly.
